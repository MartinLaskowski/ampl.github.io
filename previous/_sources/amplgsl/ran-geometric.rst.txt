The Geometric Distribution
==========================

.. function:: gsl_ran_geometric(p)

 This function returns a random integer from the :index:`geometric
 distribution`, the number of independent trials with
 probability ``p`` until the first success. The probability
 distribution for geometric variates is,

 .. math::
   p(k) =  p (1-p)^{k-1}

 for :math:`k \geq 1`. Note that the distribution begins with :math:`k=1` with this
 definition. There is another convention in which the exponent :math:`k-1` is
 replaced by :math:`k`.

.. function:: gsl_ran_geometric_pdf(k, p)

 This function computes the probability :math:`p(k)` of obtaining :math:`k` from
 a geometric distribution with probability parameter ``p``, using the
 formula given above.

.. function:: gsl_cdf_geometric_P(k, p)

.. function:: gsl_cdf_geometric_Q(k, p)

 These functions compute the cumulative distribution functions
 :math:`P(k), Q(k)` for the geometric distribution with parameter ``p``.
