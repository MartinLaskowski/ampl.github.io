AMPL Development
================

AMPL is the most powerful and intuitive tool for developing and deploying complex optimization solutions in business & scientific applications.
AMPL connects to most :ref:`open-source and commercial solvers <solvers>` and allows you to switch easily between them.
AMPL has :ref:`APIs <apis>` for several popular programming languages (e.g., :ref:`Python <apis_python>`, :ref:`R <apis_r>`, etc.) and it allows you to only model once in AMPL and interact with it using an API for a language you are familiar with.
